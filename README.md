# RentalDrives-codeVengers

## Project Description
RentalDrives is a community-driven marketplace that connects travelers with a network of trusted, local vehicle owners. We are not a traditional rental company; instead, we provide a secure and easy-to-use platform where you can discover a wide variety of cars, scooters, and bikes listed by people in Goa. Every owner on our platform is carefully verified to ensure safety and reliability, giving you peace of mind. Our mission is to make travel more personal and affordable by facilitating direct connections, so you can explore Goa with an authentic and reliable ride.
